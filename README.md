# Dart IEEE754 library

This library provides decoding and transforming IEEE754 floating point numbers
in binary format, `double` format, or as exponent and mantissa.

Examples of use cases are serializing and deserializing formats which use the
half or quad format, or encoding and converting numbers from arbitary exponents
and mantissas.
